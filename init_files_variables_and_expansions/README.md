Shell, init files, variables and expansions
Amateur
By: Julien Barbier

Description
This project consists of a series of shell scripts that demonstrate basic shell commands, handling of shell initialization files, variables, expansions, and arithmetic. Each script is exactly two lines long (the first line is always exactly #!/bin/bash), ends with a new line, and adheres to strict constraints.

Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Tested on: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Script constraints:
Each script must be exactly two lines long (use wc -l filename to verify it prints 2).
Each file must end with a new line.
The first line must be exactly:
sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
Forbidden: You are not allowed to use &&, || or ;, nor may you use bc, sed or awk.
All files must be executable.
Resources
Read or watch:
Expansions
Shell Arithmetic
Variables
Shell initialization files

Technical Writing
Man pages or help for: printenv, set, unset, export, alias, unalias, ., source, printf
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project you should be able to explain to anyone (without help from Google):

What happens when you type ls -l *.txt
The roles of /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d, and ~/.bashrc
The difference between local and global variables, and what reserved variables are
How to create, update, and delete shell variables
The roles of reserved variables like HOME, PATH, and PS1
What special parameters are (e.g., $?)
How expansions work and the difference between single and double quotes
How command substitution works using $() and backticks
How to perform arithmetic operations in the shell
How to create and manage aliases
How to execute commands from a file in the current shell
Tasks

15. What happens when you type ls *.c
Advanced Task:
Write a blog post describing, step by step, what happens when you type ls *.c and hit Enter. Explain every step (e.g., globbing, expansion, command execution) so that even a beginner understands.
